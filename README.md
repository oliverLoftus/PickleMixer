# PickleMixer
A function for mixing two concentrations of liquid to a target concentration and volume.

I made this for combining acids of different strengths, but it will work for any solution (alcohol, sugar, etc.). Enter the known values for each solution in the function, then send the desired volume and concentration as parameters. It will tell you how much of each solution you need to mix
